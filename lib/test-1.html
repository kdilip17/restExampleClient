Unless otherwise specified, any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting of the revisions on the website, and continued use of the Services after such time will constitute The Users acceptance of such changes or modifications. The User should from time to time review the Terms and any policies and documents incorporated in them to understand the terms and conditions that apply to the use of the Services.

                            <p>An invoice for the Subscription Fee will be issued each month starting one month from the date The User added the first organisation to his/her LIAD account. All invoices will include the Access Fee for the following one-month period of use. Where applicable, the Access Fee will be charged to The User's iTunes Account upon confirmation of the purchase. The User's iTunes Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to each Payment Due Date, identifying the Access Fee. LIAD will continue invoicing The User monthly (whether the Service is being used or not) until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with clause 8.</p>
